# Tournament PHP library
Tournament is a competition library to implement some php tournaments function helping to develop new sports projects.

On **index.php** file you can find an example to use the library. It's very easy, you only need call to **show_fixtures** function with the team list.

You can see the table on **index.php** with the match generated.
 
To set the number of teams you can change the **$num_team** variable.
